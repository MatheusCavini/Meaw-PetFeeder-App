# Meaw Pet Feeder: Mobile App

## Introduction

This project implements a mobile application, developed in React Native, for a pet feeding device, where the user can remotely schedule the times at which food portions need to be served. <br>
The physical device serves an API, to which the app connects and makes requests. <br>
**Make sure to also visit the device firmware respository:** [Meaw-PetFeeder-Firmware](https://github.com/MatheusCavini/Meaw-PetFeeder-Firmware)

The project was created as part of the discipline "Embedded Systems" (PMR3402) for my Mechatronics Engineering course at Escola Politécnica da Universidade de São Paulo (USP).
